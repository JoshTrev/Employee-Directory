# Employee-Directory

This directory allows the user to search employees from a file named "employees.json." This file contains employee images, names, phone numbers, emails, and dates of births. The user can search for employees using the search bar and as soon as they start typing, the application will populate with employees with information matching the user's search. The user can click any of the category labels and filter the list alphabetically by that specific category.
